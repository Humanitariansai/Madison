# Survey Analysis Platform

An AI-powered survey analysis tool that provides automated insights from survey data.

## Features
- Automated data ingestion from CSV files
- Sentiment analysis using AI
- Theme extraction and keyword analysis
- Trend identification over time
- Interactive dashboards
- PDF report generation
- Workflow automation

## Tech Stack

### Backend & Data Processing
- Python 3.11
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical computing)

### AI/ML
- OpenAI API (sentiment analysis, theme extraction)
- scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms) *[Week 2]*

### Visualization
- Plotly (interactive charts)
- Matplotlib (static plots, word clouds)

### Frontend
- Streamlit (web dashboard)

### Storage
- CSV/JSON (input data)
- SQLite (processed data storage) *[Week 2]*

### Automation
- n8n integration (workflow.json) *[Week 3]*

### Development Tools
- VS Code (IDE)
- python-dotenv (environment management)

*Items marked with [Week X] will be added in later phases*

## Author
Built as a learning project for AI/ML, data engineering, and web development skills.

What these are:
pandas - Works with data (like Excel but in code)
numpy - Math and calculations
streamlit - Creates web dashboards
plotly - Makes interactive charts
matplotlib - Makes static charts
openai - Connects to AI for analysis
python-dotenv - Manages secret keys safely
