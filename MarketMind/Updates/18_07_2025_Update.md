# MarketMinds – Project Update (Week of July 23, 2025)

## Focus Areas This Week

### 1. Expanded SWOT Analysis with Tech Startup Emphasis
We have introduced a comprehensive SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis to benchmark MarketMinds against major competitors. This analysis now reflects unique challenges and opportunities faced by **tech startups** navigating competitive intelligence and market analysis tooling. 

In particular:
- **Weaknesses** emphasize the need for more automated insight synthesis and ease of onboarding.
- **Threats** include fast-moving GenAI competitors and increasing competition from embedded analytics tools in startup ops platforms.

This enables sharper positioning of MarketMinds in an increasingly crowded landscape, aiding GTM decision-making.

### 2. Realigned MarketMinds to Focus on the Tech Sector
We have refined the project’s focus to explicitly serve tech startup ecosystems, from early-stage seed ventures to Series C. This is reflected in:
- Adjusted NLP filters in our search agent to focus on keywords like “product-market fit”, “ARR milestones”, “tech stack”, “pivot”, and “runway”.
- Fine-tuned prompt templates to pick up decision-making signals and organizational intent from startup-centric news, blogs, and job postings.
- Reworked the summary view to highlight factors like innovation rate, burn rate sensitivity, and support scalability, which are more relevant to tech operators.

This realignment allows us to deliver deeper and more context-specific insights.

### 3. Opinionated Competitor Scorecard with Manual Entry Support
We developed a feature-rich scoring framework to assess competitors across six key dimensions: Features, Market Share, Pricing, User Sentiment, Innovation, and Support & Training.

A manual input field now allows users to enter additional competitor names. When a new competitor is added, our `CompetitorAgent` automatically retrieves the relevant metadata and populates the scorecard using NLP and structured lookups. The current framework uses a 1–10 scale for scores.

Below is the current scorecard, which will be refactored next week to a 1–5 scale.

### 4. Generated Summary Pages for Strategic Decision-Making
We have developed two-to-three page summary briefs for each competitor reviewed. These follow the GitHub formatting standards and are intended to assist with executive-level decision-making. Each brief includes:
- High-level SWOT
- Interpreted scorecard breakdown
- Unique advantages & areas of concern
- Tactical implications for MarketMinds
- All sources hyperlinked in the **appendix**

The goal is not only to report, but to **interpret and recommend**, surfacing guidance that helps product and GTM teams act faster.

### 5. Added Interpretation Layer with Stronger Voice
This iteration embraces a more **opinionated** tone. Instead of neutral benchmarking, we provide analyst-style guidance interpreting what each competitor’s actions mean for MarketMinds. 

For example, Power BI’s pricing may be excellent, but the steep learning curve suggests a wedge for MarketMinds as a “plug-and-play” alternative for startups.

### 6. Added Two New Agents
We integrated two new agents:
- `SWOTAgent`: Generates contextual SWOT analysis from structured and unstructured sources.
- `CompetitorAgent`: Scrapes and scores new competitors using pre-trained industry context models and populates them into the scoring matrix dynamically.

These agents were integrated using our modular orchestrator and leverage OpenAI + Firecrawl for semantic web search and summarization.

## Next Week: Planned Enhancements

### A. Scorecard Normalization to 1–5 Scale
We will convert all scores from the current 1–10 scale to a more intuitive **1–5 scale**. Each score will be accompanied by a rationale and sourcing references in a transparent audit log.

We’ll also be running an inter-rater consistency check to verify that our scores are repeatable and logically coherent.

### B. Build and Deploy Cloud-Based UI
We plan to roll out a **Streamlit-powered cloud UI** using either **Render** or **Hugging Face Spaces**. Key goals:
- Allow Sam Ward and John Alderman to interact with the platform without local setup.
- Provide a clean front-end that reflects scorecards, summaries, and allows data export.

Initial planned UI features:
- Dropdown menus to select industry or target segment
- Text box to input competitors manually
- Switch toggle between scorecard and SWOT views
- Export buttons for PDF and CSV reports
- Button to view or download appendix with sources

This will create a no-code gateway to explore MarketMinds outputs and test its practical value for product and strategy stakeholders.

## Files Modified
- `summary/market_competition_summary.md`
- `components/input_field_competitor.py`
- `agents/competitor_agent.py`
- `data/scorecard_matrix.csv`
- `outputs/appendix_links.md`

## Closing Notes
This week's work takes a strong step toward making MarketMinds actionable, relevant, and testable by early stakeholders. With real-time analysis, clear recommendations, and a feedback-ready UI coming soon, the project is shaping up for broader demonstration and iteration.
